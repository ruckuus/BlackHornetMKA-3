### Armaggeddon [Black Hornet MKA-3 Mechanical Keyboard](http://leapfroglobal.com/amg/keyboards/black-hornet-mka-3.html) Layout for OS X

This layout is generated by [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele), however there are some keys (seems to be the ones that are independent from keyboard layout):

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Headers/Events.h
```

[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) is being used to map the keys that fire function keys.

### Installation

Copy .keylayout:

```
$ cp U.S.ARM-MKA-3.keylayout ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
```

Copy private.xml:

```
$ cp private.xml /Users/dwi/Library/Application\ Support/Karabiner/private.xml
```

After installing these files you need to logout then login again. Once you are logged in, do following:

- Enable the newly installed keyboard layout: System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > Press [+], inside Others category, choose Black Hornet MKA-3.

- Open Karabiner, the press ReloadXML, tick all newly installed actions.
